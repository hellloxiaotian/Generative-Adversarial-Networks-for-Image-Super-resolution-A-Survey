## This paper is a complete summary of generative adversarial networks for image super-resolution, which is very meaningful to readers. 

## Absract
#### Single image super-resolution (SISR) has played an important role in the field of image processing. Recent generative adversarial networks (GANs) can obtain excellent results in terms of low-resolution images with small samples. However, there are little literatures to summarize different GANs in SISR. In this paper, we conduct comparative research of GANs, according to different perspectives. We first look through developments of GANs. Secondly, we give popular architectures about GANs in big samples and small samples for image applications. Then, we analyze motivations, implementations and differences of GANs based optimization method and discriminative learning for image super-resolution in terms of supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised manners. Next, we compare performance of these popular GANs on public datasets via quantitative and qualitative analysis in SISR. Finally, we highlight challenges of GANs and potential research points on SISR.
